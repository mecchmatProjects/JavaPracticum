The Khao San Road was a famous traveller spot even before Leonardo di Caprio character in the film The Beach stayed there but it is noisy not very pretty and not very Thai
For something more authentic and Phra Kanong offers an alternative place to stay and with its fantastic street markets where everyday Bangkok people eat and work and live
It is not as convenient for the main tourist sites but it has a Skytrain station so you can be at the Grand Palace in 20 minutes
